# Doc Guard (API REPOSITORY)

Doc Guard is a white label software made to registries offices.

##### We are still developing this game, so some features are not implemented yet.

This API requires [nodejs] to run.

### ðŸ’» Stack
Current stack of this project

- [nodejs] (Language)
- [docker] 
- [nestjs] (Framework to create the structure (Like an Spring Boot))
- [prisma] (ORM that generates migrations and the interface with the database)

### ðŸ’» Tech
First of all, you should have a postgresql image running, I recommend using [docker]

After installing docker you have to create an image of postgres with docker, you should run this command below:

```sh
  docker run -d --name postgres-tcc -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456 -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

This command will generate and start a new docker image running with the latest version of postgres. (May take a while)

If you already created an image with docker, to start you must run (if your docker has a different name replace "postgres-tcc" to your custom name):

```sh
  docker start postgres-tcc 
```

After generating the image, you should populate the environment variable inside .env file (if there is no .env file, you must create using .env.example as template)

```sh
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/docguard"
```

### ðŸ”¨ Dependencies

To run this project, you must install all dependecies running the command below inside the repo, then just start the project.

```sh
$ npm install
```

after installing all dependecies run this command sync all migrations to your database: 

```sh
$ npx prisma migrate deploy
```

If everything worked properly, you must be able to start the application by running:

```sh
$ npm run start:dev 
```

Then the api will start in localhost at:

```sh
localhost:3000
```
